# global objects definitions





## debug status



if DEBUG variable is not defined it is forced to '0' -> debug mode off

verbosity levels: 0 (off=production), 1-minimum, up to 5-maximum



## main FIN object: framework



version build

Flag to be raised when FIN is printing on-screen

feedback message enabling

understandable words dictionary: FIN_framework.DICTIONARY

consecutively failed inputs: global > FIN_framework.INPUT_FAILED

time (turns) counter: global > FIN_framework.TIMELINE

interface default settings

user-framework interaction history trackers: HISTORY raw, input, done

all the generated objects are listed here: FIN_framework.ALLOBJECTS

specific story name identifier (prefix + 6 letters substring + _settings_bookmark): STORY_STORAGE

default input method (for the UI startup): keyboard, touch, (system)

when set to "false" locks interface input methods (after fatal error for example)

## basic FIN object constructor



object type:

object -> generic

player -> only one per story, ... TBD

focus -> identifies the point of view (to calculate objects in scope)

verb -> special objects that are used to trigger actions

closed -> a "closed" object stops scope propagation 

synonims

points to...

is pointed from...

connected verbs: type 0 automatically triggered

connected verbs: type 1 superficial interaction

connected verbs: type 2 light interaction

connected verbs: type 3 heavy interaction

first synonym is equal to object name (automatically pushed-in the synonims array by the object constructor)

each generated object is stored in the global array: FIN_framework.ALLOBJECTS



# CRITTER



The CRITTER manages sequential instructions execution

staus flags

if has some instructions in its queue, executes them one by one

commands queue to be executed



# The StoryWalker looks for all the possible playing paths





## StoryWalker critters constructor



initial focus object and objects array are mandatory, id is optional (default value is 0, which forces a new id definition)





## StoryWalker constructor





StoryWalkers collection with methods is added to the FIN_framework object



StoryWalker-id is a unique number: 0000--9999



## fuzzy decision maker: throws a die



parameter resembles the number of possibilities among we have to choose

possibilities enumeration starts from 0, so the return value is reduced by 1



## deep copy



returns a deep copy of a json object

make a deep copy of an object

debug



# listeners definitions



## listener: document.ready



sets up display, prints "intro" text, etc.

just for debug intents: adds special purpose interface button

step 1:

after a certain time removes the "curtain" (fader div) and gives the first output of the story

layout fine tuning setup

START variable must be defined (basic entry point)

START content is pushed in the critter queue as first element

removes the "curtain" (fader) element



## listener: mouse-clicktouch



dynamic interface adjustment for clicktuch or keyboard

stops slow-print effect if it is running

stops the mouse-clicktouch from further propagation in the DOM



## listener: generic mouse-clicktouch



prevents text selection on double-click



## listener: keyboard-keypress



stops auto-scrolling animation

preventing the first keypress from getting lost when switching from touch interface



### key [F5]



code 116 key on keyboard (standard for browser-reload page) is locked if not in DEBUG mode.



### key [F1] [ESC]



code 112 27 keys on keyboard (standard for "help") calls overlaywinmenu



### key [F4]



code 115 key on keyboard opens the secondary output window

after all key checks gives focus to FIN_layout.inputstring

if FIN_layout.feedback is shown

stopping slow-print

ignoring ctrl, shift, or other unuseful keys. Codes: 16, 17, 18, 37, 38, 39, 40



### key [ENTER]



code 13 launches inserted commands

stops further keypress propagation



# Special effects: text slow-print



flag to manage html tags

adds text to be printed to the buffer

gets characters to be printed out of the buffer

ignoring in case of <br> only TBD: non gestisce correttamente tutti i tag

else if (out=='&' && slowPrinter.fifo[0]!=' ') {

manages scrolling effect

delay time between two characters

recursion: there is still text to be printed

at the end, it stops

operations to be executed at the end:

moves printed text to to "previously" area

animated scroll-up effect



# framework management functions





## programmed instructions executioner



verb = verb type

whatobj = target objects (array)

whatactions = actions extracted from object

timeline counter is incremented anytime a significative input is recognized

'||' is used as a separator



## instruction: removes an object from scope (does not destroy the object)



ex: rem("casa");

removes lnkTo from any other linked-object

deletes lnkFrom of the object itself



## instruction: object moving



ex: mov("fungo, cappuccetto_rosso");

removes link-to from any element found in link-from of the moved object

deletes link-from

new connection link-fromlink-to setup



## instruction: moves "player" special object



FOCUS special object manipulation, following player movement:

important: modifies the point of view!

current point of view is stored in the last position of the FOCUS.lnkTo array => substituted

FOCUS.lnkTo[FOCUS.lnkTo.length-1],2);



## find object-name (string)



returns object name (first synonim)



## removes "undefined" elements from an array



returns cleaned up array



## removes multiple instances (uniq)



note: 'index', not 'indexOf'

returns cleaned up array



## in-scope objects list



builds the list of the objects currently in-scope

ex: console.log(inscope_objs_list( FOCUS ) );

checks if it's a "focus" type special object

looks inside only if the object has not been evaluated yet

in-scope search goes on through linked objects only if starting object is not any of the following types: sit, verb, closed

returns in-scope objects list as an array of strings (object names)



## synonim to object



looks for a word among synonims inside an array of objects

returns the corresponding object



## framework error signal



stops with custom message when a FIN framework error occurs

stops UI input

alert(FIN_localization.ERROR_FATAL+": "+message+"\nUI: "+FIN_framework.UI_ENABLED);

throws fatal javascript error



## elements comparison



ex: confronta(oggettoa, oggettob)

returns "true" or "false"



## verifies link-to presence in an object



ex: verifica_links(oggetto, "casa")

returns "true" or "false"



## verifies link-from presence in an object



ex: verifica_links(oggetto, "casa")

returns "true" or "false"



## defines a link from an object to another



ex: connetti("cestino","fungo")

set up link-TO

set up link-FROM

returns "true" if everything worked as expected



## removes an element from an array



returns the purged array or false if it fails



## base sixtyfour decoder



return it as is if we are in debug mode

decodes the array (also converting URI characters) and returns the plain-text version

CLEANED UP UP TO HERE



## story reset function



resets all object links and actions to what stated in the story file at the beginning

FOCUS = FOCUS_atstart;

console.log("CLEANING");

reset FIN_framework.HISTORY variables

FIN_framework.HISTORY_RAW = [];

console.log( " OBJ-ATTRIBUTES REWRITE: "+og+""+what+""+objectsDefinition[og][what], eval(og)[what] );

console.log( og, what, element[i] );



## automatic execution of in-scope objects v_0 content



for repetition prefix '_' the instruction is injected again



## main interpreter function: from instruction to object-action



records command history

STEP 1: looks for exact correspondance of composite words

converts " " -> "__" (doubles to avoid confusing "v_..." 

first loop looks for composite words

"#" is used as a placeholder for a composite word

STEP 2: corrects the wrong words

STEP 3: loop to find verb and object

var objs = [];

"wk" contains the inputstring corrected and splitted in an array of words

composite words TBDTBC

after correction: text rebuild

looks for the corresponding object

looks for the corresponding object

generic single words

if it's a verb

if it's a different type of object

>> now objs contains the object and found_verb the verb group

verb icons "disabled"

verifies maximum input length

pre-parsing: splitting multiple instructions

check if there is any grammatical separator: , . ;

the identified objects are stored here

default action: in case no verbs have been found -> v_1

STEP 5: looks for actions linked to the verb for each identified object

takes out the instruction from the object if it's not a special one _...

instructions execution

reset of fail-counter

executes recognized instructions considering the verb identified

cleans-up input space

TBD stub

evaluates in-scope objects and executes all v_0 instructions

input not understood by the framework

caller? keyboard touch system

periodic instructions (v0 verbs)



## wrapper to retrieve current focus object name



ex: current_focus()



# grammar



## 2-words-alike?

ex: stima_similitudine("bosco","boschetto")

compares va and vb end eventually switches them

for each character

calculates the proximity value from the relative distance in the two arrays



## word-changer



tries to guess the most similar word

ex: correttore_parole ("boxco",FIN_framework.DICTIONARY) >> bosco

if the word is very short it is returned as it is

for each word in the dictionary

considered only if above the % threshold

returns the new word



## substring substitution



Mozilla: https:developer.mozilla.orgen-USdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceGlobal_ObjectsStringsubstring



# interface management functions



## system message pseudo pop-up



"qna" parameter can be used to inject code to manage question and answer cases, timeout is measured in seconds

ex: qnacode = '<a onClick="\

$(FIN_layout.sysmessage).fadeOut(FIN_framework.UI_FIGURES[7]);\

">Y<a><a onClick="\

$(FIN_layout.sysmessage).fadeOut(FIN_framework.UI_FIGURES[7]);\

">N<a>'

timeout [sec]

if already present (only one popup at a time can be present)

default timeout is 30 seconds

if "qna" is "undefined" the window fades away (informative popup)

ridondanza? TBD setTimeout('if $(FIN_layout.sysmessage).fadeOut(FIN_framework.UI_FIGURES[7]); if (FIN_layout.UI_OVERLAY) { $(overlaywin).fadeTo(FIN_framework.UI_FIGURES[7],1); if (FIN_layout.UI_OVERLAY) {$(overlaywin).fadeIn(FIN_framework.UI_FIGURES[7]);} }', FIN_framework.UI_FIGURES[12]*2);



## full-screen questioning



asks for activation of full-screen mode via system_popup (fullscreen requires user interaction)



## word highlighting



toggles word-highlighting or forces it to onoff (truefalse)

forcing

toggling



## shows or hides options pseudo-window



scrolls to the top of the overlaywin contents

Adds FIN version information to the overlay window (operates only at the 2nd opening)



## overlaywin commands: change stylesheet



changes stylesheet reference

timeout set for DOM loadstartup synchronization

selected stylesheet effective load check, based on the presence of a tag-style with the same basename of the stylesheet file in the .styles directory

system popup to inform of the stylesheet load failure

changes icons style reference

white icons

black icons

default (black)



## gets display info to adapt the elements to the current view



0 returns height of browser viewport

1 returns width of browser viewport

2 returns height of HTML document

3 returns width of HTML document

4 font-size



## adds custom html tags a(wd or wdh) to the text to recognize word-clicktouch



deletes tags and punctuation for comparison

it's not a word, copy as it is

if it's included in the dictionary, adds the <wd> tag



## input-icons: verbs



### verbs group 1



invio il comando v_1 insieme al contenuto preacquisito della stringa input



### verbs group 2



se era gia` stato indicato un verbo pulisco e aggiungo il nuovo



### verbs group 3



se era gia` stato indicato un verbo pulisco e aggiungo il nuovo



## realclock show or hide



TBD-TBC

resets text in right UI button

resets text in input string space



## cleans up input space





## feedback string visualization





## real-clock updater





## identifies clicktouch on a word in the text stream (works with tags)



applies graphic effects and shows word in "FIN_layout.inputarea"

on 2nd click, v_1 interaction is fired as default



## adjusts UI for the keyboard input



hides icons & show FIN_layout.inputstring



## adjusts UI for the touch input





## font set increase



FIN_layout.inputstring must be explicitly targeted (why? TBD)



## font set decrease



FIN_layout.inputstring must be explicitly targeted (why? TBD)



## sets content of the overlaywin with some visual effects





## cleans all the output areas





## initial UI building and tuning



clock start, setting update interval (ms)

setting overlaywin tab denominations

default overlay content:

setting default tab: a, or b, or c 

put default message on "FIN_layout.reqtxtinput"

takes cookie-stored settings if available and overwrites standard "FIN_framework.UI_settings" 



## wraps all dynamic setups of the graphical layout



fine tuning lower stop-point for the output stream



## get all defined CSS selectors



useful to implement checks on css rules definition



## sound play manager



html must contain:

<embed src="piece.wav" autostart="false" width="0" height="0" id="sound1" enablejavascript="true" enablejavascript="true">

if sound data is base64 encoded
